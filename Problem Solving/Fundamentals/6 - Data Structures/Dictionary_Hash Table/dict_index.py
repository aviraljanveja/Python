# Dictionary : A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where keys are unique and immutable.

# Example dictionary: numbers as keys, squares as values
squares = {1:1, 2:4, 3:27, 4:16, 5:25}

# Indexing : Access dictionary values using keys.
print(squares[3])  # Output = 27

"""
Basically, you can use the list[] notation when working with dictionaries.
The only difference is that lists have default indexing starting at 0,
whereas dictionaries have custom keys, added as key-value pairs.
