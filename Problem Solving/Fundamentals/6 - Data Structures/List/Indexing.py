# list : A list in Python is a built-in data structure that allows you
# to store an ordered, mutable collection of elements.
# Lists are extremely flexible and versatile compared to arrays in languages like Java or C++.

# Indexing

my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]

print(my_list[0])  # Output = 1 (first element)
print(my_list[-1])  # Output = 5 (last element)
