# Regular Expressions (Regex) allows us to search for and match specific patterns of text.
# You can create a regular expression for about any pattern of text you can think of.
# First of all, to use regular expressions within Python, we need to import the 're' module :

import re

search_text = '''
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789
'''
