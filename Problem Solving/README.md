- **HackerRank** folders contain coding problems that I found most interesting and useful. These have been picked up from the **Python**, **Algorithms** and **Data Structures** sections on HackerRank. This is where you should start as the interface and level at HackeRank is beginner friendly.

- After gaining some inital confidence, you can start with **LeetCode Grind 75** which is a carefully compiled list of the most useful coding challenges from LeetCode. You can read more about it and its author [here](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/about). 

- Additionally, I have added the **Other Useful** folder to cover some interesting problems that I might have encountered elsewhere, like my own interview experiences.

- In my experience, strong fundamentals in theory along with practice through the above sources should be more than enough to build the required problem-solving muscle for any innterview level. Here, I will be posting properly commented solutions for the above problems, making it as easy as possible.
