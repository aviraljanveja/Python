- This is a Python course based on MIT 6.0001 : Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. I have simplified, re-organized and abridged the course content wherever possible / required.

- The **Chapters** folder contains the course content in PDF format. The **Chapter Programs** folder contains the coding examples for each chapter.

- It is highly recommended that learners make use of [pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/) which would allow them to visually go through the internal execution of Python programs step-by-step.

- For a 1-on-1 guidance / mentoring / doubt-solving session with myself. You can send a request on 9157790749 via Whatsapp or Email at aviraljanveja@gmail.com. More information on : [panini AI website](https://aviraljanveja.my.canva.site/)
