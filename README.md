- This is a Python course based on MIT 6.0001 : Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. I have simplified, re-organized and re-worded the course content wherever necessary as per my experience. 

- Inside each chapter, I have added Python code snippets and GitHub links, so that learners could directly see an example in real code.

- The **Chapters** folder contains the course content in PDF format, the **Chapter Programs** folder contains the in-chapter coding examples from each chapter.

- The **DSA Problem Solving** folder contains all the important algorithms, data structures and problems that I found interesting and useful. For more practice, you should check out [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75).

- Lastly, It is highly recommended that learners make use of [pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/) which would allow them to visually go through the internal execution of Python programs step-by-step.
