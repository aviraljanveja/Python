- This Python course is an abridged version of "MIT 6.0001 : Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python". 

- The 12 video lectures from the original course have been simplified and re-organized into 8 written chapters that can be followed at your own pace.

- The **Chapters** folder contains course content in PDF format. The **Chapter Programs** folder contains coding examples from each chapter. 

- The **Problem Solving** folder contains a curated list of coding problems. It is imporant to work on these alongside, so that you get well versed with data-structures, algorithms and common problem solving patterns.

- It is also highly recommended that learners make use of [pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/python-compiler.html) which would allow them to visually go through what really happens behind the scenes in a Python program.
