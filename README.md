- This is a foundational course in Python that I am currently developing. It is based on MIT course 6.0001 : Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. 

- Along with the chapters that cover fundamentals, I have also added in-chapter programs so that the learner could see a direct example right away in actual Python code. 

- Finally, there is also a folder on problem solving which includes solved problems that I thought were interesting and would help build problem solving ability while coding. These problems are mainly from HackerRank, but could be from other sources as well. Either the problem description or a link containing the same is included in the solution code itself.
