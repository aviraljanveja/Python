- This is a Python course, currently under development. It is based on the MIT course 6.0001 : Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. 

- Inside each chapter, I have added Python code snippets and GitHub links so that learners could directly see a real coded example.

- Lastly, It is highly recommended that learners make use of [pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/) which would allow them to visually go through the step-by-step internal execution of Python programs.
