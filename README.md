- This Python course is an abridged version of "MIT 6.0001 : Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python". The original 12 video lectures have been simplified, re-organized and compressed into 8 simple written chapters that can be followed at your own pace.

- The **Chapters** folder contains the course content in PDF format. The **Chapter Programs** folder contains the coding examples from each chapter.

- It is also highly recommended that learners make use of [pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/) which would allow them to visually go through what happens behind the scenes in a Python program.
