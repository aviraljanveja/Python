- This is a Python course based on MIT 6.0001 : Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. I have simplified, re-organized and re-worded the course content wherever necessary.

- The **Chapters** folder contains the course content in PDF format. The **Chapter Programs** folder contains the in-chapter coding examples.

- Lastly, It is highly recommended that learners make use of [pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/) which would allow them to visually go through the internal execution of Python programs step-by-step.
