- This is a foundational course in Python that I am currently developing. It is based on the MIT course 6.0001 : Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python. 

- Inside each chapter, I have added Python code snippets and GitHub links so that the learner could directly see a real code example. 

- There is also a folder on problem solving which contains solved HackerRank challenges. Learners should try and solve these challenges independently at first.
